## 3. Future Plan

**These files will continue to update; might be unstable**

- Highlight current active or accessed element
- Reasonable time consuming; only control changed data not whole data
- Make comb-sort and radix-sort
- User input by CSV
- Multiple windows to compare results from different algorithms
